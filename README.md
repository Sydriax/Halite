# Halite

Halite is a game meant to be played by computers.

This repository contains the environment for running Halite games and replays, a C++ starter kit for making your own AIs, and a starter AI (C++).

We're presently in the works of:
 - Formalizing and writing up the rules (eta - very soon).
 - Changing the rendering mechanism to a cleaner version (eta - very soon).
 - Adding interAI messaging (for forming alliances, coordinating attacks, etc) (eta - one week).
 - Porting the starter kits to Java and Python (eta - a few weeks).
