# Halite

Halite is a game meant to be played by computers. Halite was created by [Benjamin Spector](https://github.com/Sydriax "Benjamin Spector") and [Michael Truell](https://github.com/truell20 "Michael Truell").

This repository contains the environment for running Halite games and replays, a C++ starter kit for making your own AIs, and a starter AI (C++).

We're presently in the works of:
 - Formalizing and writing up the rules.
 - Adding interAI messaging (for forming alliances, coordinating attacks, etc).
 - Building a website to host playbacks of Halite games and to rank AIs against each other.
 - Adding the rendering of hlt files in javascript, so that they may be displayed from a website.
