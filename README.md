# Halite

## About
**Halite is still under development.** Halite is a game meant to be played by computers. Halite was created by [Benjamin Spector](https://github.com/Sydriax "Benjamin Spector") and [Michael Truell](https://github.com/truell20 "Michael Truell").

Here is a screenshot of the game visualizer (more multimedia is available in the multimedia folder):
