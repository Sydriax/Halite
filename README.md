# Halite4

Halite4 is a game meant to be played by computers.

This repository contains the environment for running Halite games and replays, a C++ starter kit for making your own AIs, and a starter AI (C++).

We're presently in the works of:
(a). Formalizing and writing up the rules (eta - very soon).
(b). Changing the rendering mechanism to a cleaner version (eta - very soon).
(c). Adding interAI messaging (for forming alliances, coordinating attacks, etc) (eta - one week).
(d). Porting the starter kits to Java and Python (eta - a few weeks).
