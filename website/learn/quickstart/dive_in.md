Joining the tournament is free! Sign up, download a starter package, make some changes, and upload your bot to the game servers to participate.

### Register Using GitHub

You will need a Github account in order to participate in the Halite tournament. If you don't have a Github account, please create a new account [here](https://github.com/join). Sign up for Halite by clicking "Login with Github" at the top right of this page.

### What information do you store about me?

We store the email, username, and unique identifier that Github provides when you login to the halite.io website via Github OAuth.

### Download a Starter Package

There are Starter Packages available for many languages on the [Downloads page](downloads.php). Use any language you like, you can always switch to a different language later!

Each Starter Package contains:
 - A code template for your first bot (the `MyBot` file in your language of choice)
 - A code sample of a random bot (the `RandomBot` file in your language of choice)
 - Additional files to help your bot interact with the environment (e.g. `Networking` and `hlt` - feel free to modify these as needed for your bot)
 - Tools to run and test your bot on your local machine

### Download the Halite Environment

In order to run your bot locally you’ll want to download the Halite environment. Follow the instructions on the [Downloads page](downloads.php) for your OS.

### Improve Your Bot

Each `MyBot` starter template is just the `RandomBot`. You can submit this to the server, but it probably won’t win very much.

Make some changes to your bot and test it locally. Use `runGame.sh`/`runGame.bat` to run your bot against the `RandomBot`. Use the [Visualizer](local_visualizer.php) to watch your local game replays. Just drag or upload the `.hlt` file to watch your bot compete.

If you need some ideas about where to start, check out some of the Tutorials.

### Submit Your Bot

You need to upload your bot to start competing against other bots on the [Leaderboard](leaderboard.php).

Create a `zip` file containing your `MyBot` file and all dependencies (usually the `Networking` or `hlt` files and any additional files you created). As an example, the Starter Package `zip` file that you just downloaded is in the correct format.

See the documentation on _ for more details about everything you can include in your `zip` file to control your bot’s compilation and execution.

You will receive an email notification that your submission has been received. The Halite servers will compile the source code of your submission and continuously play your bot against other contestants. If the compilation of your source code fails, we will email you.

### Watch Your Bot Play

As your bot competes, it will move up in the [Rankings](leaderboard.php). Visit your [homepage](user.php) to view your matches and replays against other bots.
