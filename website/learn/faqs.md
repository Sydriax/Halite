## <a name="about"></a> About Halite

### Where does the game come from? Who invented it?

The Halite game was created by [Benjamin Spector](https://github.com/Sydriax) and [Michael Truell](https://github.com/truell20) during a summer internship at Two Sigma in 2016.

The game format is inspired by the 2011 Ants AI Challenge sponsored by Google.

### Why did you invent it?

Halite’s creators heard about the Ants AI Challenge a few years too late :-(

They couldn’t find any other competitions quite like it, so they decided to create one.

### How do you determine my organization?
We check to see if the domain of the email associated with your Github account is on our [whitelist](https://github.com/HaliteChallenge/Halite/blob/master/website/organizationWhitelist.txt)).

Is your organization not on there? [Edit the whitelist](https://github.com/HaliteChallenge/Halite/edit/master/website/organizationWhitelist.txt) and send us a pull request! We'll make sure to tag all members of your organization who have already signed up.

## Bot Programming

### Do I need to be a programmer to play the game?

Yes. Halite is a programming competition. You need to program a bot that will play the game in the Halite tournament.

However, you definitely don’t have to be a very good programmer to play Halite effectively. Success is more about coming up with a good strategy to play the game than coding this strategy expertly.

### What languages does the game support?

Any and all! If the language can read from `stdin` and print to `stdout`, we can support it.

We provide out-of-the-box starter packages for the following languages: Python, Java and C++. See [here](downloads.php) for our growing list of starter packages.

We’re counting on the community to add support for as many languages as people want. Visit [this page](advanced_writing_sp.php) for more information on writing your own starter package and the protocol used by the game environment to talk to your bot.

## The Code behind the Tournament

### Is the code open source?

Yes.
