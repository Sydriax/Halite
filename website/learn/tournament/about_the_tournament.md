## <a name="about_the_tournament"></a> About the Tournament

The goal of Halite is to provide a fun and deep testbed to try new ideas and compete in problem-solving. Furthermore, Halite is being used for recruitment of talent by its sponsors.

### Who is running the tournament?
The Halite game has been designed and implemented by [Two Sigma](https://www.twosigma.com/), a highly-innovative, technological investment firm based in New York City.

The Halite tournament is jointly run with [Cornell Tech](http://tech.cornell.edu/), a new graduate school that brings together faculty, business leaders, tech entrepreneurs, and students in a catalytic environment to produce visionary results grounded in significant needs that will reinvent the way we live in the digital age.

### End Date

The tournament began on November 2, 2016 and will officially end on February 2, 2017. Submit early and often!

### Rules

- Though collaboration is highly encouraged, teams are not technically allowed. The email on an account will be used to identify the owner of a bot.
- Each participant may only have one halite account. Participants found to be in control of multiple accounts will be banned forever.
- If you find a bug that is exploitable, email us at <halite@halite.io>, do not post it on the forums, and do not exploit it.

### How are the winners decided?

Winners are simply the highest ranked players on the leaderboard at the end of the competition. So, submit early and often!

### How are rankings computed?

Rankings are based on the outcome of organized games where bots play against each other. A good analogy is the [Elo rating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system) used for chess.

More precisely, rankings are computed using a Bayesian algorithm variant of the [Glicko system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glicko_rating_system), specifically using the [TrueSkill](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/trueskill-ranking-system/) Python library available [here](https://github.com/sublee/trueskill).

### Is there a prize for the winners?

Pride! Bragging rights! Internet royalty!

The results of the competition will be officially announced with a link to best players Github profiles and/or blogs.
